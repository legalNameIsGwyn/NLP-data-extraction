The Sangir use this second phrase in the sense of “these coasts are ours to habitually come to, stay at, or depart from as at any time we may choose”. Supposedly, this phrase was corrupted and produced the name Sarangani. The name continued to convey to the Sangir the idea that the southern coasts of Mindanao always belonged to them.
